# SQL-PowerBI-Project
This project consists of a set of SQL Server queries aimed at analyzing a dataset related to Covid-19 from the years 2020 to 2023 at a global level. The queries are located in the "Queries.sql" file and the dataset can be found in the Excel file named "dataset". To test the queries, this Excel file must be imported as a SQL table. The results of the last 4 queries from the "Queries" file were used to create charts in Power BI. The files for each chart can also be found in this same repository in ".pbix" format. The dataset was extracted from the "Our World in Data" website: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths.
