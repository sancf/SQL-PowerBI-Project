# SQL-PowerBI-Project
This project involves a set of SQL Server queries designed to analyze a global Covid-19 dataset spanning the years 2020 to 2023. The queries are located in the "Queries.sql" file, and the dataset is available in the Excel file named "dataset.xlsx" To test the queries, first import this Excel file as a SQL table. The results of the last four queries from the "Queries.sql" file were used to create charts in Power BI. The files for each chart can also be found in this same repository in ".pbix" format. The dataset was sourced from the "Our World in Data" website: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths.
